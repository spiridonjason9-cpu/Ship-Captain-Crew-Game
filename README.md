I was introduced to the game after buying a dice game set. However, dice games are more fun when you have another person to play with. 
That is why I wanted to recreate the game logic in a programming language, so even if you don’t have dice or someone to play with, you can still enjoy the game. The base game logic is already implemented in this program. 
This repository is open to anyone who wishes to contribute perhaps by adding support for an extra player or AI, or by creating multiple rounds for each player to reach a cargo score of 50.
